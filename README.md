# Corona SDK 10 Basics
This is a collection of Corona SDK projects was made for an introductory presentation made in late 2013. The goal was to give participants a evolutionary, step by step coverage of fundamental components offered by the framework. All projects focus on a single component with some subsequent projects expanding on the previous project. The topics cover the following:
* Render Sprite
* Emit Sound
* Render Text
* Response to Actions
* Animate Sprite
* States
While the code has been tested to work with the latest Corona SDK (March 2nd 2019), the management of states has been outdated in favor of improved approaches.
